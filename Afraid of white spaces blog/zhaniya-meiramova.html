            <div class="lower"><center><strong class="opening-line"> Usually, I fill my page to the point I need another one .</strong>
            </center>  <p>I fill the other with random ideas, thoughts, paragraphs, songs . An adequate person would probably think of me that I am nutts. It's bonkers and makes no sense. The problem is that , white spaces creep me stiff. While I am busy writing all that comes to mind, I forget some really important things in way. As a result, it lacks structure, outline, plan, main ideas, and a goal.</p>

        <p class="hello">At the moment of writing this piece, I am pondering on what I am going to write next. I am lying on my back, while I type on my laptop. It is comfy. I am at home, in bed, in total darkness.  Except for my laptop screen that lights my face and hands making them look pale like some vampire’s skin. My eyes are sore because I am thirsty. My phone vibrated, someone texted in the telegram group. How would you structure this essay of mine? I got distracted and I am sorry for that. So there are blank pages and … well unblank.       </p>

         <p>The long term goal here and is to untangle the puzzling style of my writing. So, I rub my eyes , my bleury blue eyes, and compose myself in a comfortable position. My legs are crossed and my old rusty fellow laptop on my bed. I am a terrific writer , I think. I yawn and place my pride as far as it is possible to be . Gotcha you ! Well, the novel of mine is saying I used to boast and brag about my English. But I coul not help but wonder if I was really that good ? Turns out I was not. had to admit the hardest! The same implied my level of prograpping skills .Kind of. I can not stop it I go on writing some crap because it interests me. The crap is mundane and obvious but … Oh my sister’s sleeping here. I type I lose control of myself I get panicky. I will stop it now. Okay… give me a break and I come up with something less depressing. 
    Nope, nothing.1:28 am makes sense . I am tired and need some sleep. Hola!
